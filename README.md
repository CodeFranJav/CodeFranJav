- ðŸ‘‹ This is FranJav's repository, I have been around large datasets, scripting and light coding for years without identifying it as i=one of my passions.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™ve worked in private sector for Oil & Gas Industry and Militay Intelligence using relational databases and GIS applications.
- ðŸŒ± Nowadays  I work for a school district and its strategic planning teams. Demographic projections data, new housing development
- information and enrollment need to be analized in combination with zoning and current buildind capacities.
- ðŸ˜„ Earlier in my career I performed my own research to learn and stay up to date until I decided to it formaly. I'm currently working on my PhD in Data Science.
